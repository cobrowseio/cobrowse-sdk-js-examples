# cobrowse-sdk-js-examples

All demo pages support the ability to pass your license key into them by appending a `?license=XXX` query parameter to the end of the demo page URL.

For security reasons **do not** allow for the license key to be set via a query parameter in your own application.

## Full web demo

Demo page at [https://cobrowse-sdk-js-examples.cbrws.io/web-example/demo](https://cobrowse-sdk-js-examples.cbrws.io/web-example/demo)

This is our example project of using Cobrowse IO Web SDK in a realistic project.

The demo accepts any value for username and password and can be skipped by including `?demo=true` as a query parameter.

Using the demo page you can include your own `?license` key and `?api` via query parameters if you wish to use your own account or instance.

To run this locally please see [https://cobrowse-sdk-js-examples.cbrws.io/web-example](https://cobrowse-sdk-js-examples.cbrws.io/web-example).
